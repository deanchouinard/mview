# mview
A Markdown Viewer

I keep most of my writing in small markdown formatted text files located in
several topical directories. Mview lets me search and view those files.

Lists files from a directory. Clicking a link will display the file. Searching
displays matches and clicking a match will display the file.

Almost like a wiki except cannot edit the file. File editing is done with
another program such as a text editor or Markdown editor.

I build this for my own use. I have a lot of Markdown files and this makes it
easy to search and view their formatted representation.

Aside from my motivation to view my Markdown files, I also wanted to
experiment with Plug. So, a lot of what you see here are my explorations
in Plug.
