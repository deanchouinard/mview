# Dwiki

A notebook wiki to store my notes.

I've been using the [UseModWiki](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl) for
years at work to record my notes. I find it quick to enter text and then easy
to find stuff later. It enables me to organize information hierarchically with
separate pages for each topic or subtopic. Searching the whole page
database is convenient via a search box available on every page.

It also has been fairly easy to get running on the series of Windows workstations
I've used throughout the years since it is just a single Perl script. However,
it does require some knowledge of a web server to get running.

For the markup language I decided to use Markdown. Mostly because I already
use it and have a lot of documents in that format, and it was easy to
integrate a parser, Earmark.


Based upon Ward Cunningham's and Bo Leuf's Quickwiki in the book:

Turn into a "bliki".
