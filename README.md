# mview
A Markdown Viewer

Lists files from a directory. Clicking a link will display the file. Searching
displays matches and clicking a match will display the file.

Almost like a wiki except cannot edit the file. File editing is done with
another program such as a text editor or Markdown editor.

I build this for my own use. I have a lot of Markdown files and this makes it
easy to search and view their formatted representation.
