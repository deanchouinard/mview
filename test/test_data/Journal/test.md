### Internal Links
[[Technical/tech.md]]

[[Technical/xxxx.md]]
Link does not exist.

[[notes/note.md]]
This link will fail until *notes* dir is added into the `dirs` map. Recall that since the *notes*
dir is not initially scanned it doesn't get into the `dirs` map until it is clicked.

Noticed a problem displaying links in the search results:
<http://www.catmountain.com/test>

How about a line on a line with text: <http://www.catmountain.com/test>
Without brackets: http://www.catmountain.com/test
End of file
