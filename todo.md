Just realized it only searches in in the current tab/directory?

### 4/24/20
- was thinking I should scan the "database" and put up tabs for all directories
But, this could become unmanageable with too many tabs if your database
develops a lot of folders

- maybe not use directories and treat is all one big pool; use categories rather
than folders

- UseMod keeps pages in an alphabetical director structure; i.e.; a sub-directory
for each letter of the alphabet with pages stored in directory of their titles
first letter

### 4/23/20
- finish internal linking
- put a search box on the top and bottom of each page
- hand roll css instead of blah blah

move load_sort out of plug pipeline
evaluate tests
a lot of refactoring to do

rather than have a config file that sets the tabs, read any subdirs of the
current director and use them as tabs. Look for a .mview_tab.txt file in
each subdir for the tab description

if encounter a subdirectory make it a tab link
but, not sure how this is going to work

move any HTML building functions into their own module
